# NCHS Nav 

A progressive web app to help you find your way around school.  



## iframe branch  
Our current working demo is only an iframe to Mappedin map of NCHS we created.  
All other development on this project is located on the main branch. 

## Development
Development can be done on any computer with node and npm installed.  

After cloning this repo and `cd`ing,  

Install the project's packages: 
```bash
npm i
```  
  
Next, set up the local environment:  
1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file titled `.env.local`  
2. Create or sign in to a [mapbox account.](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/)  
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is your mapbox "Default public token"   
4. `DATABASE_URL` should be retrieved from Dr. Miller. He hosts the mysql database. It should be in the form of `mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE` 
5. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` may also be retrieved from Dr. Miller. These tokens are generated by him and are accessible from his [Google Developer Console.](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
  
To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How does this project work?
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

We are using the [Next.js app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router) built on React Server Components.  

To connect to the database, we are using an [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), an ORM. To seed the database use `npx prisma db seed`. If errors come up about not having a database connection, you need to set your environment variable for the database url in your shell before running that command. 

We are using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type saftey and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.  

To georeference the pdfs we used [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html). Look in mapping-src/ to find source files and georeferenced files.  


In the future, for when we want to figure out a routing engine, we are looking at either using Indrz or replicating their stack for routing in the backend.
