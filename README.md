This is the NCHS Nav project!

We're trying to create an app which helps people navigate and find routes throughout the school in the fastest way possible.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install the project's packages: 
```bash
npm i
```

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
